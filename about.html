              I like starting with messy ideas and slowly turning them into
              something that feels… calm. Logical. Right. Starting with a blank
              canvas, figuring out what it could be, and shaping until it fits.
              But give me an existing solution that feels slightly off, and I’ll
              happily roll up my sleeves and start working. Figma has become my
              favorite place to play, test and shape ideas into things you can
              actually click and feel.

            <p class="about-text">
              Through my bachelor’s degree in Interactive Design, I’ve gained
              experience across the full process of creating digital products.
              From user research and understanding needs, to concept
              development, prototyping, user testing and final delivery. I’ve
              worked in cross-disciplinary teams, used agile methods, and
              learned how to plan, structure and execute projects in
              collaboration with both peers and external stakeholders. My
              studies have also given me a solid technical understanding of how
              web applications are built, how data is structured, and how
              frontend and backend connect. This allows me to communicate
              effectively with developers and design within real technical
              constraints.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
              In my bachelor project, I worked closely with an established
              company to develop a digital solution based on real business
              needs. The project gave me hands-on experience in client
              collaboration, requirement clarification, project management and
              delivery — as well as adapting to new tools and technologies along
              the way. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I’ve worked as a
              photographer. It has trained my eye for detail, composition and
              atmosphere, but also for people. I bring this observational
              sensitivity into design, especially in user testing and research.

      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project was developed in collaboration with Rælingen
          municipality. Our team was tasked with creating a digital experience
          that could teach primary school children about the local history of an
          area called Byåa, known for its historic mill ruins and cultural
          trail.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal was to design an app that combines outdoor exploration,
          storytelling and play — making history feel engaging and accessible
          for younger audiences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- TEAM AND PROCESS -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Team and process</h2>
        <p>
          The team consisted of eight students across interaction design,
          front-end development and game development. Working in an agile setup,
          we collaborated closely with Rælingen municipality through workshops,
          feedback sessions and iterative prototyping.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- TARGET GROUP -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Designing for children</h2>
        <p>
          The primary target group was primary school children. This influenced
          both interaction patterns and tone of content — keeping tasks simple,
          feedback clear and navigation highly visual.
        </p>

        <p>
          To validate design decisions, we conducted user testing at schools in
          Rælingen. Observing children using the prototype helped us refine game
          mechanics, simplify navigation and adjust language to better fit their
          understanding.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- CONCEPT -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The concept</h2>
        <p>
          The app guides children along the cultural trail, presenting
          historical locations as interactive story points. At each stop,
          children unlock short stories, images and playful challenges connected
          to the site.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- GAME MECHANICS -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Learning through play</h2>
        <p>
          To make history engaging, we designed several mini-games connected to
          the trail locations. The games encouraged collaboration,
          problem-solving and discovery rather than passive reading.
        </p>

        <p>
          A long-term vision for the concept was to allow multiple real-time
          games to be created along the trail, motivating children to return,
          play together and spend more time outdoors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- INTERACTION FLOW -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Interaction flow</h2>
        <p>
          A short onboarding tutorial introduces key features, helping
          first-time users understand the app before starting the trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interface was designed to feel location-driven and easy to follow.
          Children navigate using a trail map, select nearby activity points and
          receive short, focused content designed for outdoor use. Clear visual
          navigation ensures they always understand what to do next.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- VISUAL SYSTEM -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Visual system &amp; UI design</h2>
        <p>
          The UI combines friendly typography, strong color contrast and playful
          iconography to create an interface that feels inviting. Consistent
          components and clear hierarchy support predictable interaction across
          the experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- FUTURE POTENTIAL -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Future potential: AR experience</h2>
        <p>
          A planned extension of the concept was an augmented reality feature.
          By scanning QR codes placed at selected ruins, children could point
          their camera toward the site and see reconstructions of how the
          original buildings once looked — connecting physical exploration with
          digital storytelling.

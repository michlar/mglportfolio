    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>
          Accenture’s internal event planning process was spread across multiple tools and channels.
          This created fragmented workflows, unclear structure and unnecessary friction for employees
          planning and following up events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to design a unified web application that brings planning, tracking and follow-up
          into one calm and structured interface.
        </p>
    </section>
      
    <!-- CHALLENGE -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Employees needed an interface that made it easy to plan new events, track tasks and progress,
          find past events and history, and follow up consistently across different school groups.
        </p>
      
        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Reduce fragmentation across tools and pages</li>
          <li>Make status and progress easy to understand at a glance</li>
          <li>Support a consistent flow for planning and follow-up</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
      
    <!-- INTERFACE EXPLORATION -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Interface exploration</h2>
        <p>
          I started by exploring layout systems and navigation patterns that could reduce the number of clicks
          needed to complete key tasks. Early sketches tested how dashboards, calendars and event lists
          could be structured to give immediate overview without overwhelming the user.

    <!-- ITERATION -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Refinements from feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Feedback from internal users revealed where visual cues and hierarchy were unclear.
          I refined status indicators, list structure and icon placement to make actions and system state
          easier to understand at a glance.
        </p>

        </div>
    </section>
      
    <!-- VISUAL SYSTEM -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Visual system & UI design</h2>
        <p>
          The high-fidelity design builds on Accenture’s design guidelines, allowing the work to focus on
          layout, rhythm, spacing and interaction patterns rather than reinventing visual style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consistent components and predictable navigation create a calm interface across dashboards,
          calendars and event flows.
        </p>

    <!-- FINAL UI -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Final interface</h2>
        <p>
          The final solution brings planning, task tracking and follow-up into one unified interface.
          Dashboards provide quick shortcuts to key actions, event lists support overview and filtering,
          and creation flows guide users through required inputs with clear structure.
        </p>
      
        <div class="case-gallery">

        </div>
    </section>
      
      <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>How to shape calm interface rhythm for complex internal tools</li>
          <li>How to make dense information easier to scan through hierarchy and spacing</li>
          <li>How small UI adjustments can significantly improve clarity and confidence</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>
          If I continued the project, I would explore micro-interactions to guide attention in dense views
          and make state changes even more obvious.

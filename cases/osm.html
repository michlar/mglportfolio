      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>
          Oslo Science Museum is a multi-page website concept created to promote
          exhibitions and events, provide essential visitor information, and
          encourage people to visit the museum. The interface was designed to
          appeal to a younger audience through bold layout choices, strong
          imagery and dynamic content presentation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- THE BRIEF -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The brief</h2>
        <p>
          The task was to build a modern, accessible and responsive website.
          Image and text content was to be found yourself. The design should
          appeal to youngsters without feeling childish, and communicate energy
          and curiosity through layout, typography and imagery.
        </p>

        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Home page with key information and impactful imagery</li>
          <li>
            Exhibitions page with upcoming events and available exhibitions
          </li>
          <li>Contribution page (how to contribute)</li>
          <li>Contact page with hours, address and form</li>
          <li>Document page (privacy policy + terms)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- STRUCTURE -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Structure and layout exploration</h2>
        <p>
          I focused on building a clear information hierarchy across pages,
          making it easy for visitors to find what’s happening now, how to plan
          a visit, and where to go next. Layout decisions were guided by
          scanability, predictable navigation and responsive behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- VISUAL SYSTEM -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Visual system &amp; UI design</h2>
        <p>
          The visual system was built to balance energy and clarity. Bold
          typography and strong color contrasts create an engaging identity that
          appeals to younger audiences, while consistent UI components such as
          buttons, navigation and input fields ensure predictable and accessible
          interaction patterns. Strong imagery and technology-focused content
          adds energy and curiosity to capture the attention of younger
          audiences without feeling childish.
        </p>

      <!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Design decisions for usability &amp; accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          Layout and hierarchy were shaped to make information quick to scan and
          easy to explore. Clear navigation and consistent structure help
          younger users move confidently between exhibitions, events and visitor
          information.
        </p>

        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Clear heading hierarchy and readable line length</li>
          <li>Consistent navigation patterns across pages</li>
          <li>Accessible form structure and focus states</li>
          <li>Responsive layouts with Grid/Flexbox and no horizontal scroll</li>

      <!-- KEY SCREENS -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Key screens</h2>
        <p>
          The final solution includes a homepage, exhibitions overview,
          contribution page and contact page. Each page was designed to feel
          consistent and easy to navigate, while still highlighting the museum’s
          energy.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The high-fidelity designs were implemented as a responsive multi-page
          website using semantic HTML and reusable CSS. The project was
          version-controlled in GitHub and deployed for preview, with progress
          tracked through a Kanban board.

      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>
          Rainydays is an online shop concept selling durable rain jackets for
          outdoor adventures. The project began with designing a clickable
          prototype in Figma, and continued with bringing the interface to life
          through a fully responsive, multi-page website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to translate visual design into clean, semantic HTML and
          CSS, ensuring consistent layout, clear navigation and accessible
          interaction across desktop and mobile.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- THE BRIEF -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The brief</h2>
        <p>
          The prototype was based on a predefined site architecture including a
          homepage, product listing, product detail page, checkout flow, about
          and contact pages. The target audience were outdoor-oriented adults
          aged 30–50.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- VISUAL DESIGN -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Visual system &amp; UI design</h2>
        <p>
          The visual system was built to create a calm and trustworthy shopping
          experience. Natural color tones and atmospheric imagery reflect the
          outdoor brand identity, while clean typography and generous spacing
          support comfortable reading across pages. A small set of consistent UI
          components, including buttons, product cards and navigation elements,
          ensures a cohesive interface throughout the site.
        </p>

      <!-- USABILITY DECISIONS -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Design decisions for usability</h2>

        <p>
          Key interface decisions were guided by making product browsing feel
          effortless. Large product imagery supports quick visual comparison,
          while clear typography and spacing make prices, names and
          call-to-action buttons easy to scan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Navigation was kept simple and predictable, reducing cognitive load
          and helping users understand where they are in the site at all times.
          Primary actions are consistently placed and visually distinct,
          supporting confident movement toward checkout.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- KEY SCREENS -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Key screens</h2>
        <p>
          The prototype includes a homepage, product list, product detail page
          and checkout flow. Navigation and interaction patterns were designed
          to feel predictable and friction-free.
        </p>

      <!-- IMPLEMENTATION -->
      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The final prototype was developed into a responsive multi-page website
          using semantic HTML and reusable CSS. Layouts were built with Flexbox
          and Grid, ensuring accessibility, clean structure and consistent
          interaction across devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support orientation and reduce navigation friction, a back option
          was introduced on product listing and product detail pages. The active
          page is also visually highlighted in the main menu, reinforcing users’
          sense of location within the site.
